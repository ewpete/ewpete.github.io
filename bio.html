        <h1> Eric's Biography </h1>
        <p> I was born in Burlington, Vermont, but mostly raised in Ridgefield, Connecticut. I am the only son in my family, and have two older sisters. I have been playing soccer since I was five years old, and even play today on the Tufts Club team. My parents bought me my first drum set when I was ten, and I always found myself playing in my own groups, the jazz band, and even the marching band.</p>

       
        <p> I came to Tufts in 2011, originally intending to be an Electrical Engineer. Since then I've changed my course quite a bit. First, I switched to Quantitative Economics, and later decided to double major, adding Computer Science. I'm a huge live music and festival fan, and have gone to Bonnaroo in Manchester, Tennesee twice now. </p>

        <p> When I was younger I would spend my summers at Lakeside Field Club, swimming, diving, and playing tennis. As I got older I became a lifeguard and swim coach, too. However, I've spent my last two summers in Boston doing data analytics internships at startup incubators. </p>

        <p> After I graduate, I will spend my summer traveling and then move to NYC to work on the business side of IBM Watson. Wish me luck! </p>
